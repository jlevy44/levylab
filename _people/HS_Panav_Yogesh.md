**About Me:**
I am Panav Mhatre a high school student at Lebanon Trail High School. Throughout my time in high school, I have taken courses related to computer science, engineering, and mathematics. I enjoy building computer algorithms that can help solve problems faced in the real world through artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am interested in Levy lab partly due to the increased impact AI is having in our daily lives. With that, there has been an increased focus on building models that are ethical and fair to all genders and ethnicities. I am good at problem-solving, creative thinking, and programming. I am a self-taught developer with proficiencies in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In my free time, I love to spend time with my friends and family and watch soccer, golf, and F1. 

**Project/Research Interests:**
I was super interested in working with tumors and tumor growth, especially with ArticAI. I was also interested in working with the Thyroid Cancer.
