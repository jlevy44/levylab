However, batch effects may potentially obscure the ability of machine learning methods to derive complex associations within spatial omics data. Profiling thirty-five stage three colon cancer patients using the GeoMX Digital Spatial Profiler, we found that mixed-effects machine learning (MEML) methods† may provide utility for overcoming significant batch effects to communicate key and complex disease associations from spatial information. These results point to further exploration and application of MEML methods within the spatial omics algorithm development life cycle for clinical deployment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Evaluation for dyssynergia is the most common reason that gastroenterologists refer patients for anorectal manometry, because dyssynergia is amenable to biofeedback by physical therapists. High-definition anorectal manometry (3D-HDAM) is a promising technology to evaluate anorectal physiology, but adoption remains limited by its sheer complexity. We developed a 3D-HDAM deep learning algorithm to evaluate for dyssynergia.
METHODS Spatial-temporal data were extracted from consecutive 3D-HDAM studies performed between 2018-2020 at a tertiary institution. The technical procedure and gold standard definition of dyssynergia were based on the London consensus, adapted to the needs of 3D-HDAM technology. Three machine learning models were generated: (1) traditional machine learning informed by conventional anorectal function metrics, (2) deep learning, and (3) a hybrid approach. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using bootstrap sampling to calculate area-under-the-curve (AUC). To evaluate overfitting, models were validated by adding 502 simulated defecation maneuvers with diagnostic ambiguity.
RESULTS 302 3D-HDAM studies representing 1,208 simulated defecation maneuvers were included (average age 55.2 years; 80.5\% women). The deep learning model had comparable diagnostic accuracy (AUC=0.91 [95\% confidence interval 0.89-0.93]) to traditional (AUC=0.93[0.92-0.95]) and hybrid (AUC=0.96[0.94-0.97]) predictive models in training cohorts. However, the deep learning model handled ambiguous tests more cautiously than other models; the deep learning model was more likely to designate an ambiguous test as inconclusive (odds ratio=4.21[2.78-6.38]) versus traditional/hybrid approaches.
CONCLUSIONS By considering complex spatial-temporal information beyond conventional anorectal function metrics, deep learning on 3D-HDAM technology may enable gastroenterologists to reliably identify and manage dyssynergia in broader practice.},

	abstract = {What is the relationship between mortality and satellite images as elucidated through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks?Background: Following a century of increase, life expectancy in the United States has stagnated and begun to decline in recent decades. Using satellite images and street view images, prior work has demonstrated associations of the built environment with income, education, access to care, and health factors such as obesity. However, assessment of learned image feature relationships with variation in crude mortality rate across the United States has been lacking.Objective: We sought to investigate if county-level mortality rates in the U.S. could be predicted from satellite images.Methods: Satellite images of neighborhoods surrounding schools were extracted with the Google Static Maps application programming interface for 430 counties representing {\textasciitilde}68.9\% of the US population. A convolutional neural network was trained using crude mortality rates for each county in 2015 to predict mortality. Learned image features were interpreted using Shapley Additive Feature Explanations, clustered, and compared to mortality and its associated covariate predictors.Results: Predicted mortality from satellite images in a held-out test set of counties was strongly correlated to the true crude mortality rate (Pearson r = 0.72). Direct prediction of mortality using a deep learning model across a cross-section of 430 U.S. counties identified key features in the environment (e.g., sidewalks, driveways, and hiking trails) associated with lower mortality. Learned image features were clustered, and we identified 10 clusters that were associated with education, income, geographical region, race, and age.Conclusions: The application of deep learning techniques to remotely-sensed features of the built environment can serve as a useful predictor of mortality in the United States. Although we identified features that were largely associated with demographic information, future modeling approaches that directly identify image features associated with health-related outcomes have the potential to inform targeted public health interventions.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in malignancy rates and molecular alterations based on the presence of different criteria. Methods A laboratory information search was conducted to identify thyroid fine-needle aspiration specimens signed out as AUS. The cases were reclassified as architectural atypia (3A), cytologic atypia (3C), both architectural and cytologic atypia (3B), or Hürthle cell aspirate (3H). Surgical follow-up and concurrent molecular test results, if available, were collected. Results Five hundred ten specimens, including 258 reclassified as 3A, 40 reclassified as 3B, 119 reclassified as 3C, and 86 reclassified as 3H, were identified. The risks of malignancy for the subcategories were 13.4\%, 26.3\%, 44.1\%, and 13.8\%, respectively. Additionally, BRAF V600E mutations were more prevalent in specimens with cytologic atypia (3B/3C), whereas low-risk alterations, including KRAS, PTEN, and PAX8-PPARy2, were more prevalent in those with architectural atypia (3A). Conclusions Subdividing AUS specimens on the basis of the type of atypia can yield categories associated with distinct molecular alterations and risks of malignancy.},

	abstract = {The diagnosis of disease often requires analysis of a biopsy. Many diagnoses depend not only on the presence of certain features but on their location within the tissue. Recently, a number of deep learning diagnostic aids have been developed to classify digitized biopsy slides. Clinical workflows often involve processing of more than 500 slides per day. But, clinical use of deep learning diagnostic aids would require a preprocessing workflow that is cost-effective, flexible, scalable, rapid, interpretable, and transparent. Here, we present such a workflow, optimized using Dask and mixed precision training via APEX, capable of handling any patch-level or slide level classification and prediction problem. The workflow uses a flexible and fast preprocessing and deep learning analytics pipeline, incorporates model interpretation and has a highly storageefficient audit trail. We demonstrate the utility of this package on the analysis of a prototypical anatomic pathology specimen, liver biopsies for evaluation of hepatitis from a prospective cohort. The preliminary data indicate that PathFlowAI may become a cost-effective and time-efficient tool for clinical use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms.},
